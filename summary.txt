I read Breaking into Data Engineering (2024) and liked how it showed the role is more than just coding—it’s about connecting software engineering, cloud platforms, and data architecture. Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham also resonated with me since I’ve seen firsthand how messy datasets slow everything down, and his framework makes analysis much cleaner and more reproducible. The Five-Layered BI Architecture paper was also interesting because it emphasized how metadata and layered design are critical for enssuring data quality and reliable decision-making.
